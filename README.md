# Tic Tac Toe Magic Square Game

This is a simple Android application developed in Java and Kotlin, using the Android Studio IDE. The game is a unique take on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, where the win condition is based on the concept of a magic square.

A magic square is a grid of numbers (in this case, a 3x3 grid) where the sums of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal are all the same. In this game, the magic square is used to determine the winner. When a player (either X or O) completes a row, column, or diagonal that sums up to 15, they win the game.

The game features a simple and intuitive user interface, with a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board. Players take turns clicking on the buttons to place their symbol (X or O), and the game checks after each move to see if a player has won.

The project uses Gradle for build automation and dependency management.
